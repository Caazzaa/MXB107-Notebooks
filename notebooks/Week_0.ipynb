Originally designed for Python, it also supports other languages like R. Colab provides access to powerful computing resources, including GPUs, making it ideal for data analysis, machine learning, and interactive coding tutorials. Its integration with Google Drive ensures that your notebooks are automatically saved and easily shareable, making collaboration seamless and efficient."
